# GitHub Issue Post Comment

This is a Rails application that acts as a GitHub App to automatically detect when a new GitHub issue is created and writes a comment to remind the issue creator to provide a time estimate if itâ€™s missing. This helps the team scope and schedule projects more effectively.

## Features

- **GitHub App Integration:** Uses a GitHub app to integrate with GitHub's APIs and subscribe to events.
- **Issue Creation Event:** Listens for the `issues` event and handles the `opened` action, which is triggered when a new issue is created.
- **Estimate Detection:** Analyzes the body of the newly created issue and checks if it contains an estimate in the format "Estimate: X days" (e.g., "Estimate: 2 days").
- **Reminder Comment:** Posts a comment on the issue, reminding the issue creator to provide an estimate if it's missing.

## Usage

1. **Create a new issue:**

   - Create a new issue without an estimate in the body. (https://github.com/vineelvineel/github_sample_repo/issues)
   - The app should automatically comment on the issue, reminding the creator to add an estimate.
